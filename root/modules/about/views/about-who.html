<p>
My name is Mathieu Sylvain, and I'm a web developper in his thirties with a marvelous girlfriend, a two year-old girl and a day job.
</p>
<p>
I do not have a dozen code ninjas or web monkeys working for me and I have no venture capital investor showering me with money.
</p>
<p>
I'm building Wrook mostly alone, out of my free time and with no budget.
</p>
<p>
I've been coding since the age of 15 and building web sites since Internet Explorer 2.
For me, wrook is a way to have fun while building something which I believe is for a "greater good".
</p>
<p>
I'd welcome any help and would relish the possibility of getting sponsors, but until then I'm still having a lot of fun!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cheers!</strong>
