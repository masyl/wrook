<h3>Q: What does "Half Baked" mean ?</h3>
<p>
It simply means that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It still has plenty of bugs</li>
<li>Some feature are incomplete</li>
<li>Not all features are available yet</li>
<li>Its not quite secure or stable yet</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, <strong>You can eat some, but it might taste funny</strong>!</li>

<h3>Q: If I start adding my stuff, am I at risk of loosing it?</h3>
<p>
Short answer: Yes. Long answer: I suggest you keep copies of whatever you write
on your computer. I try to make sure nothing is lost when features are updated, but
the fact is that not enough testing has been done and backups are not being done yet.
So, just be carefull.
</p>

<h3>Q: When will it be "Fully Cooked"?</h3>
<p>
Development is moving along great and new features come in daily. I dont know
exactly how much needs to be done so that early members are satisfied with it, but
I personnaly would like to start advertising around January.
